# ROS_CartPole_DDQN
This repository presents a reinforcement learning (RL) solution based on the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) method within the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, aimed at the challenging task of balancing a pole. Using the DDQN algorithm, the agent learns to balance a pole attached to a cart.
